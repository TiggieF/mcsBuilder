# mcsBuilder Manual

## Premise
You oversee a late-night build of the new MCS campus. Two workers (Builder and Delivery) follow your orders. Manage their stamina, keep the wood flowing, and finish all 10 floors before they burn out.

## Controls
- **WASD** – move the foreman avatar around the campus.
- **Space** – interact with zones or workers (check stamina, grab coffee, deliver coffee).
- **Pause button** – toggles the simulation.
- **Speed button** – cycles through time acceleration.
- **Contrast button** – switches to a high-contrast palette.
- **Worker card buttons** – assign Build/Fetch/Rest orders.

## Rules of play
1. Delivery must ferry enough wood from the Wood House to the MCS build site.
2. Builder can only start a floor when the wood stock meets the current floor requirement.
3. Each worker spends stamina while performing actions and must rest in the dorm when drained.
4. Coffee from Starbucks instantly refills every worker. Pick it up and hand it to a nearby worker.
5. Floors complete in sequence. Finish all 10 floors to win.

## Scoring & win conditions
- HUD progress bars track wood stock and overall campus completion.
- The top HUD shows total time, floors complete, and Delivery’s stamina tier.
- When floor 10 is finished the win overlay appears with your completion time.
- There is no fail state; the challenge is to finish quickly by juggling stamina, coffee boosts, and efficient orders.
