# Stage 00 — Playtest & Feedback Guide

Welcome to the first playable scaffold of **mcsBuilder**. Follow the steps below to experience the build, confirm Stage 00 deliverables, and capture any feedback before we advance to the next stage.

## 1. Launch the build
1. Open `index.html` directly in a modern desktop browser (Chrome/Firefox).
2. Ensure the window is large enough to display the entire 900×900 canvas without scrolling.

## 2. Learn the controls
- **W / A / S / D** – Move the player around the map.
- **Space** – Trigger the contextual interaction bubble (text placeholder) when standing near a zone or worker.
- **UI Buttons** – Click Pause, Speed, Contrast, and Worker buttons to observe the current placeholder responses.

## 3. Explore the map
1. Walk the 30×30 grid to visit each zone:
   - MCS main structure (central).
   - Wood house.
   - Starbucks stand.
   - Sleeping quarters with beds.
2. Verify collision boundaries prevent walking through solid structures.
3. Check that worker placeholders appear with "idle" labels floating above their heads.

## 4. Confirm the HUD & panel
- HUD shows wood stock, floor level, progress percentage, and total elapsed time.
- Control panel contains Pause, Speed, Contrast, and Worker action buttons with basic placeholder interactions.
- Contrast toggle flips between default and high-contrast palettes.

## 5. What to look for
- Smooth 30 FPS feel (no obvious stutter while moving).
- Interaction bubble appears and disappears as expected.
- Player remains centered on the grid squares.
- Overall presentation feels ready for future content layering.

## 6. Capture your feedback
Record any notes about:
- Visual clarity, sizing, or layout quirks.
- Input responsiveness or collision bugs.
- Additional UI tweaks desired before Stage 01.

Share this feedback during the stage approval review so the next iteration can incorporate your findings. Enjoy exploring Stage 00!
